# Custom-Dijkstra

I wrote this implementation to learn about Dijkstra's algorithm. It is by no means the fastest and was not tested for use in critical applications.

Right now it is set up to use a graph designated in a csv file, parsing the file with an open source 3rd party library under the BSD-3 licence. No error checking is currrenly run on the graph generated by the file!
